# Seeking Feedback

## Introduction

After completing the initial designs for Berimbolo Security's website, I will begin the process of seeking feedback to enhance the quality and appropriateness of the designs. This involves showing the designs to relevant stakeholders, gathering and analyzing the feedback received, and identifying areas that could be improved. Based on this feedback, I will further develop and refine the designs, ensuring they meet the users' needs and are fit for purpose. Throughout this process, I will justify my design decisions, explaining how they respond to the feedback and considering alternative options. Additionally, I will detail which suggested changes were implemented, which were not, and the reasoning behind these decisions.

## Feedback from Users

### Feedback from User 1

#### _Positive Feedback:_

-   The animations on the **homepage** and the '**About Us**' page, implemented using the [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) library, were appreciated for their quality and effectiveness.

#### _Areas for Improvement:_

-   The fixed footer was reported to overlap with the content during navigation, causing a disruption in the user experience. This feedback is under consideration for improving the layout of the website.
-   The color scheme was not found appealing by the user. However, this feedback will not be incorporated as the current color scheme aligns with the brand identity and has been positively received by other users.

### Feedback from User 2

#### _Areas for Improvement:_

-   The user suggested that the FAQ page could be integrated into the homepage to reduce redundancy and streamline information access. This feedback is under consideration.
-   The hero section was reported to contain excessive content, potentially overwhelming users. Simplifying this section is under consideration to enhance clarity and focus on key messages.

### Feedback from User 3

#### _Positive Feedback:_

-   The responsive design across most pages was praised, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
-   The color scheme was appreciated for its aesthetic appeal, contributing to the overall attractiveness of the website.

### Feedback Conclusion

This feedback provides valuable insights into the user experience of the website highlighting areas for potential improvement. Each piece of feedback will be carefully considered to enhance the design and functionality of the website, with the aim of creating a user-friendly, informative, and engaging platform for Berimbolo Security's services and products.

## Further Development Based on User Feedback

Based on the feedback received from the users, I will further develop and improve the designs as follows:

1. **Addressing the Overlapping Footer Issue**: I will revise the layout of the website to ensure that the fixed footer does not overlap with the content during navigation, thus improving the overall user experience.

**Before Fixation:**

<center style='padding: 1rem; padding-bottom: 0.1rem;'>

</center>

**After fixation:**

<center style='padding: 1rem; padding-bottom: 0.1rem;'>

![](images/FootAfter.png')

</center>

suggested fix for the design:

2. **Considering Integration of FAQ Page into Homepage**: I will explore the possibility of integrating the FAQ page into the homepage to reduce redundancy and streamline information access, enhancing user convenience.

3. **Simplifying the Hero Section**: To address the feedback regarding the excessive content in the hero section, I will simplify this area to focus on key messages, ensuring clarity and preventing user overwhelm.

4. **Maintaining the Color Scheme**: While some users expressed dissatisfaction with the color scheme, I will maintain it as it aligns with the brand identity and has been positively received by other users. However, I will consider subtle adjustments if necessary to address any specific concerns.

5. **Continuing Responsive Design**: I will ensure continued responsiveness across all pages to maintain a seamless user experience across various devices, as praised by one of the users.

By implementing these improvements, I aim to enhance the overall quality and appropriateness of the website designs, better meeting the needs of Berimbolo Security and its users.
