### ADT:

ADT's website uses a **responsive design**[²](#sources-and-references). It also uses **high-quality images and videos** to showcase its products, enhancing user engagement[²](#sources-and-references). But its design is a little bit confusing and not organized, you'll feel lost inside the website not knowing where to go, but it solves this problem by its clear navigation bar and verbose footer with all the necessary links for navigation.

## Conclusion

Both websites are well-designed and offer a range of features that meet the needs of their respective audiences. They provide comprehensive information about their products, making it easy for users to make informed decisions. These insights could be beneficial for Berimbolo Security as they plan and develop their new website. They might consider incorporating similar features, such as detailed product descriptions, customer testimonials, and a user-friendly design, into their own site. But overall I think that Vivint's website is better suited for its intended audience, as it is more user-friendly and more appealing with a clearer UI and a more modern design.
